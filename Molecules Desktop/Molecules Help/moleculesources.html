	<h1>Molecule Sources</h1>
	<p>Molecules can read structures in the PDB, SDF, and XYZ formats. These files can be downloaded from a number of places.</p>
    <p>A set of sample molecules ships with the application as part of its disk image. These sample molecules are: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>DNA: This is the <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1BNA">1BNA structure</a> from the RCSB Protein Data Bank, as described by H.R. Drew, R.M. Wing, T. Takano, C. Broka, S. Tanaka, K. Itakura, and R.E. Dickerson in Structure of a B-DNA dodecamer: conformation and dynamics. Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.USA 78: 2179-2183 (1981).</li>
        <li>Transfer RNA: This is the <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=4TRA">4TRA structure</a> from the RCSB Protein Data Bank, as described by E. Westhof, P. Dumas, and D. Moras in Restrained refinement of two crystalline forms of yeast aspartic acid and phenylalanine transfer RNA crystals. Acta Crystallogr.,Sect.A 44: 112-123 (1988).</li>
        <li>Caffeine: This is the calculated structure of caffeine, as obtained from NCBI's PubChem for <a href="http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=2519&loc=ec_rcs">CID 2519</a>.</li>
        <li>Theoretical atomic pump: This is a <a href="http://www.imm.org/research/parts/pump/">theoretical molecular model of an atomic pump</a> that is selective for neon, as developed by K. E. Drexler and R. C. Merkle.</li>
    </ul>

	<h3>RCSB Protein Data Bank</h3>
	<p>The <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb">RCSB Protein Data Bank</a> is an international repository of biomolecule structures and information about the research that led to their discovery. This repository can be searched to find molecular structures of proteins, oligonucleotides, and other larger biomolecule structures. PDB files can then be downloaded from there and viewed in this application.</p>

	<h3>NCBI PubChem</h3>
	<p><a href="http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">NCBI's PubChem</a> is a repository of small molecule compounds and their generated 3-D structures. Many common compounds, such as those encountered in chemistry or organic chemistry courses, are present within this database and can be found in a quick search. Many of these compounds have calculated 3-D structures which can be downloaded by clicking the Download SDF button in the upper-left of a molecule's page, then choosing the 3D SDF: Save option.</p> 
	
	
	<h3>File sharing with the iOS Molecules application</h3>
	<p>The iOS version of Molecules has built-in search and download capabilities from the above two resources, and any molecule downloaded to that application can be viewed within this one. To copy over files from the iOS version of Molecules, connect your iOS device to iTunes, and go to the device within that application. Browse to the Apps tab and scroll down to the File Sharing section. Click on the Molecules entry in the table to the left and a list of structures downloaded by that application will appear on the right. Drag those structures out of there and into a folder on your Mac and you'll be able to view them within this application.</p>
