	<h1>Mouse and Leap Motion Controls</h1>
	<p>Once loaded, a molecular structure can be interacted with using either the mouse or a <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com">Leap Motion Controller</a>. Both methods of interaction can be used at the same time.</p>

	<h3>Mouse controls</h3>
	<p>A molecule can be manipulated to rotate, scale, and pan it within the displayed window. Clicking the left mouse button and dragging rotates the structure about the center of the display. Holding the Shift key while dragging up and down zooms the structure in and out. The structure can also be zoomed in on by using the mouse's scroll wheel (or a scrolling gesture on a trackpad). Holding the Command key while dragging pans the molecule around the view.</p>
	
	<h3>Leap Motion controls</h3>
	<p>The Leap Motion Controller allows you to use your hands in open space to interact with your computer in a unique manner. In Molecules, this is used to provide a direct manipulation of molecules using 3-D hand movement.</p>
	<p>To start interacting with a molecule, select a molecule window to make sure it's active and taking input. Move an open hand within the field of view of the Leap Motion Controller and the molecule will start responding.</p>
	<p>Movements parallel to the screen (left-to-right, top-to-bottom) will rotate the molecule. Movements toward and away from the screen will scale the molecule, as if you were pulling or pushing it. Bringing two open hands into view of the Leap Motion Controller will let you pan the molecule by moving both hands parallel to the screen.</p>
	<p>Finally, if you wish to stop interacting with a molecule using your hand, close it into a fist and your movements will no longer be registered.</p>
